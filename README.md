# Vainglory XP Fame Tracker for Discord

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/starfoxcom/VGXPBotCore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/starfoxcom/VGXPBotCore)
This is a simple, yet useful Discord Bot made on .Net Core with the help of [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net) which makes easier to keep track of the XP Fame of members on a guild in the mobile game Vainglory.

## How it works

The commands are easy to use and the help provided by the bot is easy to understand, some of the functionalities that it has are:

 - Sign up members
 - Show member stats
 - Update member stats
 - Show list of members
 - Delete a member

and much more.

**Note:** Vainglory **doesn't have an API** to provide Guild data. This bot just **improves the way to keep track of guild members XP Fame** right on Discord **without the need of any form of document**. The bot takes in account the **Discord user ID's to fetch and update the data** from it's database, so **members have to be on the Discord server** or it would not work as intended.
## Try it out!

If you want to give it a try and see for yourself if the bot is what you're looking for you guild, don't hesitate and [add it to your Discord server
